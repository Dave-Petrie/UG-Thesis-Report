\subsection{QUT Electricity Consumption and Generation Data} \label{section:QUT-Data}

%New Paragraph
To design a feasible commercial building incorporating low voltage DC electricity an approximate building size and layout was required. QUT's Building Management Services department kindly provided access to building schematics and metering data. Operation and maintenance manuals including electrical drawings, single line diagrams, architectural drawings and electrical specifications were received. These were integral to designing an accurate, ``real world'' model to test the feasibility of the proposed system.

\subsubsection{Meteo Control}

%New Paragraph
The first data management system that QUT has installed is Meteo Control Energy \& Weather Services. This system connects and monitors the four separate PV arrays that QUT has installed throughout the Garden's Point Campus; P Block Level 10, P Block Pergola, P Block Solar Trees and Y Block Level 11. Figure \ref{fig:qut-map-pv-markup} below shows an exert from Google Maps with mark-ups of these sections in practice. This monitoring system provides enormous quantities of useful data including: 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Technical data 
	\item Info Center
	\item Data analysis
	\item Monitoring
	\item Reporting
	\item Metering management
	\item Solar Account (Finances)
	\item Environment (Carbon Footprint)
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}



%New Paragraph
The main page provides an intuitive summary of the modules to provide information on the life of the installation shown below in Figure \ref{fig:qut-lvl10-meteo-summary}. This image was taken at May 15, 2017 for the P Block Level 10 and shows the existing returns that the specific installation has provided. It also breaks down the production curve for the day and daily production for the month and year so far. Although the financial information is useful, installations of PV will vary in the financial benefits. 
\newline

%New Paragraph
The reasoning behind is that different energy providers will allow certain benefits and installations for varying costs. For example, if a client wishes to back-feed (also known as feeding electricity to the grid) certain agreements are required to be made with providers in order to be considered a generator. Additionally, depending on the size of the installation, module manufacturers or distributors may give different discounts per unit reducing the overall capital outlay and reducing the return on investment.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Power Monitoring Expert}

%New Paragraph
The second monitoring software that QUT Facilities Management allowed access to is Power Monitoring Expert v8.0. This will be used to provide an insight into the load demands of the building that would impact design. Figure \ref{fig:qut-summary-dashboard} outlines the Garden's Point Electricity Metering system. The data is access through a interface closely linked with the single line diagrams of buildings including main switchboards (MSBs), distribution boards (DBs) and transformers. This information is critical to understanding optimal power system design.

	\label{fig:qut-summary-dashboard}
\end{figure}

%New Paragraph
The EMS system additionally outlines how the PV system at QUT operates and what power it generates. The solar panels act as a load reducing generator rather than direct appliance powering. During the day the panels generate electricity and with a regulator and converter combination the DC generated power is converted to AC and fed into the University's power systems. The benefit of utilising the equipment in this way is that it reduces peak consumption which is when electricity prices are highest. The major difference between this design and the one which this project seeks to design is the panels will be directly powering loads.

\subsubsection{Useful Data Interpretation}

%New Paragraph
This section outlines the collation, analysis and interpretation of acquired data. Due to the quantity of data, the scope of the project was carefully considered during analysis. 

\paragraph{Photovoltaic Breakdown}
~\\
QUT P Block Level 10 (the same as Figure \ref{fig:qut-lvl10-meteo-summary}) was chosen as a model to analyse the modules, inverters and power quantities produced. Table \ref{table:qut-pblock-lvl10-pv-breakdown} shows the breakdown of the 405 panel, 101.31\,kWp installation. The specific model of module that was installed were the Suntech STP250-20/Wd which are a commercially available and average priced mono-crystalline 250\,W panel. Additionally, there were two variants of the same model inverter installed. These are the 3.6\,kW and 10\,kW versions of the Power-One PVI OUTD/S. The sections on the physcial rooftop are outlined in Figure \ref{fig:qut-map-pv-pblock-lvl0-markup}.

\paragraph{Photovoltaic Production Data}
~\\
Without production data, module quantities and associated inverters is of limited use. This monitoring system can provide and graphically represent the production over custom periods. To get accurate readings for Brisbane, Queensland (the location of the proposed system) the year of 2016 was assessed to give an accurate represented of predicted production capabilities. Table \ref{table:qut-pv-lvl10-2016} outlines the figures exported by Metero and Figure \ref{fig:qut-pv-lvl10-2016} shows the graphical representation of the output as well as irradiance. 
\newline

%New Paragraph
Table \ref{table:qut-pblock-lvl10-pv-breakdown} shows that the peak power of the entire system is 101.31\,kWp. Annually, the system generated 157,331\,kWh of power equating to 1,522\,kWh\,/\,kWp\,/\,year. To analyse whether this is a typical production expectation, the University of Queensland provides free access to their solar production data \cite{website:UQData1}. The output of this system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:uq-pv-st-lucia-2016} with a 2,250\,kWp system producing 2,428,422\,kWh in 2016 \cite{website:UQData1}. This equates to 1,080\,kWh\,/\,kWp\,/\,year which was surprisingly low. An industry rule of thumb is that in Brisbane with tilt angles close to the lattitude and north-east facing, production from a PV installation can receive 1,500\,kWh\,/\,kWp\,/\,year. It should be noted that this assumption is reinforced by QUT's production data and will be used for future modelling assumptions.

\paragraph{Useful Conclusions}
~\\
An important conclusion to make from this data is that the 405 panel installation with a 101\,kWp over 1 year can produce 157,331\,kWh. A simple calculation therefore gives us a loose approximation that each panel, in Brisbane over 1 year will produce 388\,kWh. This can be used to calculate the demand required for the power systems to establish a system for AC powering and then conversions for DC. There are a few key characteristics and assumptions that will be required:
\newline
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Real Power = Apparant Power * Power Factor
	\item kWh is the measurement energy providers charge against (quantity of kW consumed within a one hour period)
	\item kVA is the measure that maximum demand is charged against
	\item DC Power Production is approximately 7\% higher than AC from these modules (from System Advisor Model)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Power Monitoring Expert}
~~\\
Similar to the photovoltaic metering system, the Power Monitoring Expert (PME) product that QUT uses provides a large amount of data that needs to be analysed. PME also shows summary pages of the separate locations on both the Garden's Point as well as breakdowns to electrical infrastructure as represented in Figure \ref{fig:qut-pme-pblock-summary}.

~~\\
What data needs to be exported? To solve this the model for Level 7 of P\,Block as levels 7, 8 and 9 have the highest density of office rooms per level for the building. Figure \ref{fig:project-model-pblock-lvl7} shows the lighting layout for level 7 and the quantity of luminaires installed. Additionally, it separates the floor plan onto the different distribution boards DB-P-7A, DB-P-7B and DB-P-7C. Following the floor plan, the building's power systems must be separated to understand where the power for the lighting comes from so the correct infrastructure can be observed within the metering system. The extract from the single line diagram is also shown in Figure \ref{fig:project-model-pblock-lvl7-sld-extract} showing that each DB is split to separate power and lighting metering units. This will be integral to estimating the required electricity for lighting loads.

The three DBs were found in Power Monitoring Expert for both the power and lighting meters. This was exported into a 600 page report and excel spreadsheet. The metering system produced data in 15 minute increments which was totalled and aggregated into relevant intervals. Figure \ref{fig:pblock-lvl7-monthly-kw} is the graph of the average monthly lighting demand for level 7 over all three DBs. It can be seen that there are only minor differences along each month drawing the conclusion that time of year has a negligible effect on the lighting consumption of this floor.

Although this information is useful for the production vs consumption curves the kwH are required for financial information. The graph shown in Figure \ref{fig:pblock-lvl7-monthly-kwh} shows the monthly breakdown of the calculated kWh values. It should ne noted it is just a scaled down replication of the kW graph.

Due to this finding, it was beneficial to model the average daily lighting consumption over each metering period. Figure \ref{fig:pblock-lvl7-15-minute} below shows the consumption curve and can be used to compare against production to determine feasibility.

\paragraph{Lighting Considerations}
\paragraph{Sensors}
~\\
In this scenario, the building is within a University requiring different demands. For example, standard business hours in Brisbane are between 8:30\,AM and 5:30\,PM but Figure \ref{fig:pblock-lvl7-15-minute} shows that consumption begins earlier than this and finishes later. Additionally, lighting consumption never hits zero implying that there are always lights on. Additionally, upon analysis of the building documentation, P Block has lighting control systems including personnel sensors, light level sensors and illuminance sensors indicating that people are likely in the room at all hours driving the average consumption above zero. Additionally, as a public space it is unlikely that every light in the building is turned off at any stage. 

\paragraph{Emergency Lighting}
~\\
An additional consideration relevant to the consumption not lowering to zero is emergency lighting. These decides are generally left on at all times for the purpose of directing human traffic in the event of an emergency where general lighting is not available. Emergency lighting will be relevant to any commercial building within Australia as per Australia Standards AS 2293.1 Emergency lighting and exit signs \cite{StandardsAustralia2293}. 

\paragraph{Annual Periods}
~\\
In addition to the sensors, a University building will have varied consumption depending on the time of year. This is due to:
\newline
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
	\item During study period (In-Semester)
	\item Out of study period (Non-Semester)
	\item Weekday
	\item Weekend
\end{itemize}

All these factors must be considered in the final design. The assessed data could be potentially useless if the varying periods of increased people traffic within the building. Figure \ref {fig:pblock-lvl7-15-minute-detailed} represents the new graphical representation of consumption comparing various yearly period factors and finding the 15\,minute average. Additionally, standard business hours have been marked by the two vertical red lines. This area begins at 8:30\,AM and finishes at 5:30\,PM.  

\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
	\item Average In-Semester (Dark Blue)
	\item Average Entire Year (Orange)
	\item Average Weekend (Grey)
	\item Average Weekday (Yellow)
	\item Average Out of Semester (Light Blue)
\end{itemize}

	\caption{QUT Garden's Point Data: P Block Level 7 Detailed 15-Minute Interval Lighting Demand (kW)} 
	\label{fig:pblock-lvl7-15-minute-detailed}
\end{figure}
  
\paragraph{Useful Conclusions}
~\\
Analysing the graph above, the only variables that impact the consumption significantly is whether it is during the week or a weekend. It can be seen that weekend consumption does not increase at the same rate and the maximum is approximately 50\% less. Because this data is being used for the modelling of a ``real world" corporate building, the spikes of consumption at 5\,AM will be reduced so the gradiant of the curve begins increasing at 6:30\,AM and shifts to minimum at 7\,PM. The extended hours are to account for employees who arrive at work early and leave later.  Additionally, offices generally do not consume on the weekends meaning that the Yellow line from Figure \ref{fig:pblock-lvl7-15-minute-detailed} is the most accurate.
