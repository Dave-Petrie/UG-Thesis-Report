\section{Future Work}

\paragraph{}
Now that this report is close to answering the initial questions proposed in the beginning there is interest in progressing the research further. With the previously discussed increase in both renewable energy device efficiency and installations of DC systems for data centres and mining sites it would be worth furthering the research in utilising purely DC systems in more applications. 

\paragraph{}
The first suggestion would be to power more devices in small apartment buildings. The suggested layout from experience gained through this research project would be to power constant high loads such as fridges, freezers and air conditioning with the existing AC but all other devices could be powered off DC. To reduce consumption from the grid, renewables can be used for at least partial consumption reduction and a dedicated DC switchboard can be installed for each apartment. 

\paragraph{}
If the system proves successful for small scale homes such as apartments there is cause to see it implemented in areas where reliable electricity is not available. Further analysis into a new supplementary form of micro-grid for essential services such as lighting, cooking and heating should be completed.
