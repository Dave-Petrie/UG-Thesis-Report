\subsection{Timeline Analysis} \label{appendix:Timeline}

\paragraph{}
The tasks were be split into days and University weeks. It was ensured to include the holidays during periods where University is not run. This project does not simply end upon the completion of this semester. BEB801 is concluded on November 4th at the end of Week 14, however BEB802 is the subject allocation to complete the second half of this project. The task table will allocate SMART milestones. Additionally, the benefits of completing the subjects during this period is that there is the additional time from summer holidays to account for.

\paragraph{}
Table \ref{table:timeline_original} on the following page shows the milestones of this project. The University assigned submissions are represented as bold text. The four major deliverables for the first half of this project are the library assessment, project proposal, oral presentation and progress report. These four deliverables are what have outlined how the remaining tasks have been created and the time periods allowed for. Earlier due dates are set to allow for editing or possible difficulties to occur without major repercussions. 

\paragraph{}
Table \ref{table:timeline_revised} represents the revised timeline with completed times. This is for the benefit of both the creator of this project as well as any future students who wish to progress the project and extend its scope. There are a variety of reasons as to why there were extensions of time for completing milestones. It is not an irregular occurrence that project plans are extended and this project is no different. As previously discussed, deadlines were set at least 1 week early with the intention of ensuring proper preparation is done and deadlines are not missed.
